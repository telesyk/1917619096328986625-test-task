## Description of work that has been done

For style naming, implemented styles-methodologies combining `BEM & SMACSS`.

As a project bundler tool, used `Parcel`.

In CSS regularly utilizes `CSS-variables` as a useful feature to avoid repetitive shared parts of styles and as a quick way to provide changes to values from one place.

Styles are maximally divided into logical `css-components`. 

JS is mostly used to trigger events and toggle the 'active' state for some of the elements.
